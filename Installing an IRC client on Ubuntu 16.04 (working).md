Method 1: Installing a Snap via Snapcraft
Since we’re installing for Ubuntu Linux, click the Snapcraft link in the center.
This will open a download window for a Snap file. Snap files are universal packages for Linux – kind of like .exe files for Windows. If the Snapcraft link does not work or errors out, click the Source Archive link to the right of the Snapcraft link and proceed to Method 2.
